# Introduction

In 2017, 47,600 people died of an opioid overdose (68% of all overdose deaths). 
Our study explored the effect of integrating the prescription drug 
monitoring program into the electronic heath record on physician prescribing 
behaviors in emergency department. Billions of dollars are being spent to 
reduce opioid addiction in the US. Stakeholders need data on the most effective 
efforts but given all the attention, guidelines and interventions, the actual 
effects of interventions can be difficult to disentangle from secular time 
trends. Instituting an intervention effort across multiple sites 
simultaneously can be expensive. Through simulations, we demonstrate 
that three sites can be used to evaluate the effects of an intervention 
using a step wedge design even in the presence of complex secular time 
trends and site effects.

## Objectives

1. Explore how PDMP itegration effects prescribing behaviour.
2. Simultate different "truths" and evaluate how well they are captured by the 
model.

# Methods

Data on all non-admitted emergency room visits and outpatient prescription 
medications for each phase were collected from the EHR(electronic health 
record). data were also collected on searches of the PDMP data base, 
the controlled substance prescription
record (for six months before and after the visit) and the NaRxcheck score.  
11 different scenarios with varying secular time trends, site effects, 
intervention effects and interactions were simulated. 

**_Now on to the results!_**

# Results

Our study found that introduction of the PDMP 
into the workflow did not reduce overall opioid prescriptions but did 
reduce the prescribing rates in high risk individuals. Our simulations showed 
that even with only one site per cluster secular time trends and interaction
effects were actively seperated.

# Key Takeaways

*	It is not clear that overall opioid prescribing rates are measurably 
affected outside of the overall secular time trend.

* Simulations indicate we can reasonably detect intervention effects 
even given complex site and time effects.
